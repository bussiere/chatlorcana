 
Based on the initial filtering of cards from the Lorcana deck, here are some cards that might align with the control and annoyance strategy similar to black/blue decks in Magic: The Gathering:

1. **Freeze**: An action card with a cost of 2 that allows you to exert an opposing character. This can disrupt your opponent's strategy by limiting their options.
2. **Steal from the Rich**: This action card has a higher cost of 5 but has a potent effect that causes each opponent to lose 1 lore whenever one of your characters quests. This can effectively hinder your opponent's progress.
3. **Control Your Temper!**: A low-cost action card at just 1 that decreases a chosen character's strength by 2 for the turn, potentially neutralizing a threat.

These cards can provide control over the board state, disrupt opponents' plans, and offer strategic advantages during gameplay. To build a full deck around these concepts, you'd want to include a mixture of characters, actions, and items that align with these control themes, ensuring a balance of cost and effectiveness. Keep in mind to adhere to the deck-building rules, such as the minimum number of cards and the limit on copies of each card.
