The quick start rules for the Lorcana card game have been outlined as follows:

1. **Deck Composition**: A player's deck can include characters, actions, and items, referred to as "glimmers." These glimmers can be Disney characters and items that assist players in quests or challenges.

2. **Gameplay Objective**: Players aim to collect pieces of lore scattered across Lorcana. The first player to accumulate 20 lore wins.

3. **Card Functions**:
   - **Characters**: Sent on quests and into challenges, some with special abilities.
   - **Items**: Provide special abilities and remain in play once played.
   - **Actions**: Offer one-time advantages and are discarded after use.
   - **Songs**: A special type of action that can be played without cost if sung by a qualifying character.

4. **Playing Cards**: Cards are played by paying their ink cost, with each card exerted in your inkwell equaling one ink.

5. **Challenges and Questing**: Characters can be exerted to go on quests or challenge opponents' characters, dealing damage based on their strength. A character is banished (removed from play) if the damage equals or exceeds their willpower.

6. **Deck Building**: Decks must contain at least 60 cards, with no more than four copies of any single card, and can only contain cards from one or two ink types.

7. **Turn Order**:
   - **Beginning Phase**: Ready exerted cards, check for start-of-turn effects, and draw a card.
   - **Main Phase**: Actions include adding a card to your inkwell, playing cards, activating items, using character abilities, questing, and challenging.

8. **End of Game**: The game ends when a player reaches 20 lore or if a player's deck runs out of cards, in which case they lose the next time they would draw a card.

These rules provide a framework for the strategic play of Lorcana, emphasizing deck customization and the tactical use of characters, items, and actions during gameplay【13†source】.
